# Libraries to Install

We normally build the Firmware with the Arduino IDE.

The board should be set to "ESP32 Dev Module".

A number of libraries must be installed.  This is an incomplete list:
* ElegantOTA v. 3.1.7 by Ayush Sharma
* ESP AsyncWebServer by ESP32Async
* Async TCP by ESP32Async

(There are many other more common libraries.)
